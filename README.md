This was a project I created for my own pleasure and personal training while I was abroad in Hong Kong.

The idea behind it was to create a Mastermind puzzle game written entirely in Flash ActionScript 3.0.

To play, pick different colors to try to figure out the hidden code. A red dot signifies right color, right spot. A white dot signifies right color, wrong spot. You get 10 guesses. Try to crack the code.

Enjoy!
